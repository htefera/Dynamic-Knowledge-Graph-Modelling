# Semantic-Data-Management
# Ontology-Based Publication System

## Project Overview

1. **Ontology Development:**
   - Develop and explore an ontology for a publication domain, including authors, papers, conferences, and reviews, with well-defined relationships and properties.

2. **Tool Utilization:**
   - Utilize advanced tools like Protege and OpenRefine to create a comprehensive TBOX (Terminological Box) defining classes, object properties, and datatype properties for the ontology.

3. **Dataset Transformation:**
   - Employ OpenRefine and RDF extensions to convert diverse datasets into RDF format, creating a meaningful ABOX (Assertional Box) and linking it to the established TBOX.

4. **Linking ABOX to TBOX:**
   - Establish a robust link between the ABOX and TBOX using SPARQL queries, confirming the integration of individual instances into the broader ontology structure.

5. **Analytical Queries:**
   - Conduct analytical queries on top of the ontology, demonstrating its utility for extracting valuable insights and knowledge, such as finding authors, exploring properties, and understanding the relationships between entities in the publication domain.

## Repository Structure

- **/ontology:** Contains files related to ontology definition (TBOX).
- **/data:** Includes datasets in CSV format.
- **/rdf_conversion:** OpenRefine project files for converting CSV to RDF.

## Usage

1. **Ontology Definition:**
   - Explore `/ontology` for the TBOX definition in Protege.
   
2. **Dataset Transformation:**
   - Utilize OpenRefine in `/rdf_conversion` to transform CSV datasets into RDF format.
   
3. **Linking ABOX to TBOX:**
   - Use SPARQL queries in `/rdf_conversion` to establish links between ABOX and TBOX.

4. **Analytical Queries:**
   - Leverage SPARQL queries in `/rdf_conversion` for analytical insights.
